dotfiles for my berrywm rice, tbhk-themed

## inspiration
well i havent finished the anime yet but i noticed no one has ever tried making their rice into nothing but a specific anime, and because i found gruvbox convenient, thats how the rice was born

oh and yeah, im not guaranteed that using what i put here will work, you might have to modify more stuff
